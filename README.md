1. Head First Design Patterns.


## Design Principles
* Favor composition over inheritance.
* Encapsulate what varies.
* Program to interfaces, not implementations.
* Strive for loosely coupled design between objects which interact.


# Loose Coupling
When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but have very little knowledge of each other. Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.

## Design Patterns

1. Strategy pattern
defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.

Example:

2. Oberver pattern
defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
