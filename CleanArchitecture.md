- Structured programming is discipline imposed upon direct transfer of control.
- Object-oriented programming is discipline imposed upon indirect transfer of control.
- Functional programming is discipline imposed upon variable assignment.

## SOLID principles
The SOLID principles tell us how to arrange our functions and data structures into classes, and how those classes should be interconnected

### SRP (Single responsiblity principle)
Each software module has one and only one reason to change.

### OCP (Open closed principle)
System should be open to extension and closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution principle
This principle says that to build software systems from interchangeable parts, those parts must adhere to a contract that allows those parts to be substituted one for another. If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of the program.

### Interface segregation principle
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

### DIP (The Dependency Inversion Principle)
The code that implements high-level policy should not depend on the code that implements lowlevel details. Rather, details should depend on policies.
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
- If component A should be protected from changes in component B, then component B should depend on component A.
